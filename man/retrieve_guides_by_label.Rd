\usage{
retrieve_guides_by_label(
  df,
  gene_pairs,
  gene_col1,
  gene_col2,
  label_col1,
  label_col2,
  guide_cols
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe where each row corresponds to a single guide construct that targets 
two genes, which contains the columns named in the variables gene_col1, gene_col2, 
label_col1, label_col2 and guide_cols.}

\item{gene_pairs}{Dataframe returned by \code{unique_gene_pairs}.}

\item{gene_col1}{A column containing the first of two gene names. Intergenic regions must be 
denoted as "---" and non-targeted genes must be denoted as "None".}

\item{gene_col2}{See above.}

\item{label_col1}{A column specify whether the guide in gene_col1 targeted an exonic or
intergenic region, which must be labeled as "exonic" or "intergenic".}

\item{label_col2}{See above, but for gene_col2.}

\item{guide_cols}{A list of all columns containing log-normalized fold-changes.}
}
\value{
A list indexed by unique gene pairs that contains the gene names in the keys 
  "gene1" and "gene2". Each column specified in guide_cols has its guide values 
  stored in two keys, one for each orientation. For instance, the column "DMSO_T15"
  will have its values stored in the keys "orient1_DMSO_T15" and "orient2_DMSO_T15".
  The guide type is additionally contained in the key "guide_type".
}
\description{
Gets all guides in each orientation for all unique gene pairs and the given columns.
Assumes that orientation is determined by label columns which specify whether each
guide targets an exonic region or an intergenic region. Exonic-targeting guides must
be labeled as "exonic" and intergenic-targeting guides must be labeled as "intergenic".
The column specified by label_col1 corresponds to the gene names specified by the 
column gene_col1, and similarly for label_col2 and gene_col2.
